Simple json data visualized in table form


## 📊 Dynamic Product Table with JSON and CSS 🎨

---

> **This project demonstrates how to create a **dynamic HTML table** using **JSON data** and **CSS styling**. The table is generated dynamically based on the JSON file, and the styling is applied using a separate CSS file. Perfect for displaying product data or any tabular information!** 🚀

---

## 💥 Features

- **Dynamic Table Generation**: The table is created dynamically using JavaScript based on the JSON data.
- **Custom Styling**: Beautifully styled table with custom fonts, borders, and hover effects. 🎨
- **Responsive Design**: The table is responsive and works well on all screen sizes. 📱💻
- **Easy to Customize**: Modify the JSON file to update the table data or tweak the CSS for custom styling. ✨

## 💻 How It Works

### 1. **JSON Data (`data.json`)**
   - Contains the table settings, headers, and rows.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
         "tableSettings": { ... },
         "headers": [ ... ],
         "rows": [ ... ]
     }
     ```

### 2. **CSS Styling (`styles.css`)**
   - Contains all the styling for the table, including:
     - Custom fonts (Roboto from Google Fonts).
     - Rounded corners and shadows.
     - Hover effects for rows.

### 3. **HTML File (`index.html`)**
   - Loads the JSON data and CSS.
   - Dynamically generates the table using JavaScript.

## 🛠🍉 Customization

1. Open the `data.json` file.
2. Modify the `headers` or `rows` arrays to update the table content.
